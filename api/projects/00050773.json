The intended outcome of the Mozambique PEI II is the integration and operationalization of environmental sustainability into national and sectoral policy planning and budget processes, including through some provincial and district level activities, with a view to assist in the implementation of the National Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, the main priorities for the PEI phase II are to strengthen the national capacity for mainstreaming environment into plans (i.e. PES) and budgets across sectors, and increase national and decentralised funding levels and budgetary allocations for environment. In this respect, PEI is working closely with the MPD, the MICOA and environmental units in various sectors. Trainings will be held with the MPD for district, provincial and sector planners on how to integrate environment into PES 2012. \r\n\r\nMoreover, targeted support will be provided to environmental units in the sectors, such as in the Ministry of Agriculture and in the Ministry of Mining.  An important part of the PEI approach is to make the case for environment's contribution of pro-poor economic growth and, hence, the importance of increased investment in sustainable practices across sectors. For this purpose, the following studies will take place in 2011:  1) a comprehensive economic analysis of environment's contribution to poverty reduction and development in Mozambique, 2) a public environmental expenditure review in order to improve and increase national budget allocations for environment across sectors, 3) a study of existing and potential economic instruments for environment in Mozambique as a source of funding for the improved environmental management.","output_id":"00062853","output_title":"Poverty Environment Initiative"}],"project_descr":"Mozambique Poverty and Environment Initiative (PEI) Phase II, Implementing partner UNEP","project_id":"00050773","project_title":"Poverty and Environment Initiative, PEI II, MOZ","region_id":"RBA","start":"2008-06-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00050773","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-12.5","lon":"39.4","name":"Cabo Delgado","outputID":"00062853","output_locID":"00062853-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050773","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-25.05194","lon":"33.64417","name":"Gaza","outputID":"00062853","output_locID":"00062853-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050773","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-17.87861","lon":"36.88833","name":"Zambezia","outputID":"00062853","output_locID":"00062853-3","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
