It helps to revise the policy on community based natural resource management and assists to develop conservation strategies for the Mongolian parts of the Altai and Sayan mountains. The project seeks to do this by 1) integrating biodiversity conservation objectives into sustainable natural resource use policy, programs, and practice and 2) linking traditional protected area management to the landscape around each area, including cross-border cooperation.  Around 116 herder groups are supported to form community partnerships, improve livelihoods and engage in conservation.","output_id":"00039250","output_title":"Altai Sayan Conservation"}],"project_descr":"PIMS 1929 BD FSP: Community-based Conservation of Biological Diversity in the Mountain Landscapes of Mongolia's Altai Sayan Eco-region","project_id":"00036215","project_title":"ALTAI SAYAN conservation","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2004-06-08","subnational":[{"awardID":"00036215","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"48.96833","lon":"89.9625","name":"Bayan Olgii","outputID":"00039250","output_locID":"00039250-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00036215","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"48.00556","lon":"91.64194","name":"Khovd","outputID":"00039250","output_locID":"00039250-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00036215","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"51.10697","lon":"100.48645","name":"Khovsgol","outputID":"00039250","output_locID":"00039250-3","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00036215","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"49.5","lon":"93","name":"Lake Uvs","outputID":"00039250","output_locID":"00039250-4","precision":"4","type":"RES"}]}
