Direct implementation of UNDP's support to the DPG Secretariat will reduce the administrative burden for Government and ensure the most direct and efficient delivery of project services. This will be delivered in tandem with the related support to national implementation of the second, more comprehensive support to GoT aid management.\nThe DPG Secretariat Project addresses the UNDP-led support to the DPG coordination and harmonization process through Direct Implementation by UNDP. The intervention builds on strong delivery during the past 7 years to the DPG. The Project aims at improving aid coordination and harmonization within the DPG in order to strengthen the engagement of the DPG in the implementation of the JAST agenda while simultaneously providing advisory services to key Government institutions, most notably Ministry of Finance URT (MoF) as well as the President's Office Finance, Economy and Development Planning (POFEDP) of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar.","output_id":"00079141","output_title":"DPG Secretariat"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00061971","project_title":"DPG Secretariat","region_id":"RBA","start":"2011-07-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061971","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"-6","lon":"35","name":"Tanzania","outputID":"00079141","output_locID":"00079141-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
