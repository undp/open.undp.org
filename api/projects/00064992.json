The per capita income of US$424 places the country below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 54 percent of its population of 163.874 is poor and 15 percent live in extreme poverty. The country ranks 131 out of 182 countries in the 2009 UNDP Human Development Index. Life expectancy is 67 years and adult literacy rate is estimated at 83%. The HIV epidemic in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe shows characteristics of both generalized and concentrated epidemics. According to the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2008/2009, the prevalence of HIV infection in the general population aged 19-49 years old is 1.5%, which corresponds to a pattern of generalized epidemics. However, the prevalence among men (1.7%) is higher than among women (1.3%), which characterize concentration of cases in high-risk groups. These findings are reinforced by the data from sentinel surveillance that points out a low prevalence (0.6%) among pregnant women and a high prevalence among sex workers (4.2%). This program will address the following HIV/AIDS issues in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, among others: voluntary testing and counseling; prevention activities for targeted populations, including sex workers and their clients and men who have sex with men (MSM); integration of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services at the health district level; and treatment for opportunistic infections.","output_id":"00081638","output_title":"STP HIV/AIDS RESPONSE"}],"project_descr":"STRENGTHENING THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC RESPONSE AMONG VULNERABLE GROUPS AND MOST-A-RISK POPULATION IN S.TOME E PRINCIPE.","project_id":"00064992","project_title":"STP HIV/AIDS RESPONSE","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00064992","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"1","lon":"7","name":"Sao Tome and Principe","outputID":"00081638","output_locID":"00081638-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
