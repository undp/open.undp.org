The project will contribute to the alleviation of poverty from the development of knowledge, capacities, strategies, instruments and tools, including social, poverty and gender variables into the planning processes of the integrated management of solid waste at national and local (in Arequipa as pilot) levels.  Synergies between the gradual formalization of recyclers and environmental, social and economic opportunities will be identified and pursued.  \r\n\r\nThe work in the solid waste sector is an adaptive solution to minimize extreme poverty for vulnerable populations and the project will promote activities that will have a long term impact in the reduction of poverty levels and in the financial sustainability of recycling associations.  With the contribution of United Nations Volunteers, the project will promote an environmental friendly and segregation culture through a local volunteering approach and citizen participation.  \r\n\r\nThe 5 principal results of the project are:\r\n1.\tInstitutional and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of the Environment through the integration of social, poverty and gender variables into the solid waste management system in Peru;  \r\n2.\tInstitutional and capacity strengthening in the Provincial Municipality of Arequipa to improve the integrated management of solid waste through the incorporation of social, poverty and gender variables.  \r\n3.\tStrengthened recyclers associations and favorable conditions towards long term financial sustainability;  \r\n4.\tThe population of Arequipa mobilized and a waste-friendly and recycling culture generated;\r\n5.\tThe experiences of the project have been systematized and replication opportunities have been promoted.","output_id":"00084988","output_title":"PEI Peru"},{"award_id":"00045896","budget":[50000.0],"crs":"41010","crs_descr":"Environmental policy and administrative management","donor_id":["00041"],"donor_name":["UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME"],"donor_short":["UNEP"],"expenditure":[48954.0],"fiscal_year":["2013"],"focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"This Project aims to strengthen the capacities of local communities including LGUs to access and manage assets and revenues from environment and mineral resources for local development.
