The most important of these are increasing human security for communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and releasing government resources used for stockpile management thereby enabling them to be invested in other priority public sectors.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on three distinct outputs:\r\n\r\n1. Increased national capability for ammunition control through enhanced capacities for environmentally benign ammunition destruction and stockpile management;\r\n\r\n2. Enhanced capacities of the state, entity and Brcko District institutions to control and manage weapons possession, collection and disposal in line with international standards;\r\n\r\n3. Capabilities of municipal and law enforcement authorities enhanced to ensure consummate improvement of community security and security perception of citizens in selected municipalities.", "donor_short": ["SWE", "UKM"], "expenditure": [3177606.0, 2964891.0, 726044.0, 25524.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "Crisis Prevention & Recovery"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00041575", "output_locID": "00041575-1", "name": "Banja Luka", "focus_area": "6", "lat": "44.4633", "type": "PPLA", "awardID": "00037913", "lon": "17.118", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Crisis Prevention & Recovery"}, {"outputID": "00041575", "output_locID": "00041575-2", "name": "Sanski Most", "focus_area": "6", "lat": "44.46", "type": "PPL", "awardID": "00037913", "lon": "16.401", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Crisis Prevention & Recovery"}, {"outputID": "00041575", "output_locID": "00041575-3", "name": "Sarajevo", "focus_area": "6", "lat": "43.864", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00037913", "lon": "18.414", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Crisis Prevention & Recovery"}], "operating_unit": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "budget": 4030989.0, "iati_op_id": "BA", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2005-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "BIH", "expenditure": 6894065.0, "document_name": [["Project Document SACBIH final V1 - new as of 2009 - substantive revision.doc"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00037913/Project Document SACBIH final V1 - new as of 2009 - substantive revision.doc"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00037913", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.ba/", "project_title": "small arms control programme"}
