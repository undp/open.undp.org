In addition to these, three new business incubators were set up in 2010-2011, while four others are in the final development stage and due to launch by Q1 of 2012.\r\n\r\nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are small and medium local start-ups and early-stage businesses. The tenant SMEs join a three-year business incubation programme, whereby they receive support in the form of equipped office spaces, start-up grants and consultancy services.
