Year one is focused on quick impact activities that resuscitate the village economy in 500 villages. Year two will focus on moving towards more sustainable livelihoods in 750 villages through an integrated approach to early recovery at the community level. A variety of assistance (conditional direct financial support for livelihoods, in-kind support, support for community works) will be delivered through community-based organizations. Sectoral support (health, environment, education, and shelter) will be delivered through the same CBOs to reinforce and improve livelihoods. The project places a special emphasis on the most vulnerable households  female and single male parent headed households, orphaned children, landless and casual labourers, the elderly alone and people with disability  and will provide them a differentiated package of support. The project is designed to benefit equally women and men, however, attention to women's special needs will be taken into consideration and addressed. Reducing disaster risk and enhancing community-based disaster preparedness is a cornerstone of this project.","output_id":"00062308","output_title":"Nargis-Early Recovery","zero_years":[]},{"award_id":"00013948","budget":[0.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_budget":[0.0],"donor_country":["Norway"],"donor_country_id":["NOR"],"donor_expend":[1059.0],"donor_id":["00187"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY"],"donor_short":["NOR"],"donor_type_id":["NON_PROG CTY"],"expenditure":[1059.0],"fiscal_year":["2013"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Post-Nargis Recovery & Preparedness Plan (PONREPP) Support to Co-ordination Arrangements","output_id":"00073436","output_title":"Recovery Coordination","zero_years":["2013"]},{"award_id":"00013948","budget":[1.0,9163.0,349125.0,null],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_budget":[1.0],"donor_country":["MULTI-LATERAL AGENCY"],"donor_country_id":["MULTI_AGY"],"donor_expend":[0.0,47319.0,339962.0,107147.0],"donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"donor_type_id":["MULTI_AGY"],"expenditure":[0.0,47319.0,339962.0,107147.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011","2010"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Output#1: Promoting inter-agency coordination to enhance information sharing and advocacy on DRR at different level. \t\r\nOutput#2: Risk assessments and documentation of good practices for improving DRR programming \r\nOutput#3: Promoting Mainstreaming DRR into livelihood-focused programmes\r\nOutput#4: Supporting Communities for disaster resilience","output_id":"00076015","output_title":"DRR Research&Interagency coord","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"Integrated Community Development Project","project_id":"00013948","project_title":"Integrated Community Development Project-ICDP","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2004-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00013948","lat":"20.54735","lon":"96.91609","name":"Inle Lake","precision":"1","type":"RES"},{"awardID":"00013948","lat":"17","lon":"95","name":"Ayeyarwady","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00013948","lat":"20.78919","lon":"97.03776","name":"Shan","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00013948","lat":"20.14956","lon":"94.93246","name":"Magway","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
