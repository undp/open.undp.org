It focuses on the delivery of four essential basic public services\u2014primary and junior secondary education, basic health care, social insurance and employment services\u2014and analyses the important national goal of \"equalization\" of access to these, closely linked to the equity goal that was presented in the 2005 report.\r\n\r\nFor the China National HDR 2009/10, UNDP China took the initiative to focus this National Human Development Report on the topic of \"Sustainable Future: Towards a Low Carbon Economy and Sustainable Society\". By analyzing both the risks and potential benefits to China of a shift to a low carbon economy and society, it is hoped that this report will provide a considered contribution to China's rapidly evolving policies in this area. The report highlights that, if China can fully grasp the opportunities at hand, it will be possible to move to a society which is not only environmentally sustainable, but which creates the conditions for greater job creation, greater resource efficiency and energy security, enhanced food security, and better health outcomes for its people; a society which, in line with China's own Xiaokang vision, is well balanced and moderately prosperous.","output_id":"00053802","output_title":"National Human Devpt Report"},{"award_id":"00045532","budget":[1384145.0,514775.0,207011.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00012","00089","00187","00551","11234","55460"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions","GOVERNMENT OF CHINA","GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY","DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT","Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)",null],"donor_short":["UNDP","CPR","NOR","DFID","AusAID"],"expenditure":[574194.0,463220.0,72100.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"This programme serves as an umbrella to support policy and research through inter alia studies, dialogues, events and networks.
