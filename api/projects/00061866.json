The objective is to update the annual Mexican Inventory of anthropogenic greenhouse gases to period 1990-2009, including the implementation of an inventory's information System, as defined by the UNFCCC for Annex I countries. Adaptation measures and options that could be implemented in Mexico for relevant sectors will be identified, and Regionalized scenarios of climate change at a higher spatial resolution will be generated applying dynamic downscaling, to reduce uncertainties in V&A assessments. Current and future potential mitigation policies and measures for key sectors will be identified and reported. Description of national circumstances will be updated, including a report on the priorities, objectives and development implications to address CC. The project will continue to build institutional capacity, including undertaking activities related to research, education and awareness.\r\n\r\nRegionalized scenarios of climate change at scale of 20 x 20 km\u00b2 will be generated applying dynamic downscaling to reduce uncertainties in V&A assessments.
