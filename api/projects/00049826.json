Yet rapid urbanisation is stretching the public administration capacities of Viet Nam's cities to efficiently control and harness inclusive and environmentally sustainable development. The objective of the project is to build the capacity of the Ho Chi Minh City Local Authority (HCMC People's Committee) in planning and management so that they are better able to achieve equitable and inclusive socio-economic growth and environmentally sustainable development. \r\nTo be implemented by HCM City People's Committee, the project will serve the purpose of developing and piloting a new urban governance Model.\r\nIn HCM City's endeavours to become a modern city and a key player in the region, the project will assist in pulling in and utilising international good practice. The lessons learned from HCM city as a \"test bed\" can be adjusted to local circumstances and adopted accordingly.\r\nThe project has a 48-month duration (2007-2011).
