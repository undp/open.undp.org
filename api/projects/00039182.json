The Knowledge Hub was designated the WHO Collaborating Centre for Capacity Building in HIV/AIDS Surveillance in March 2008. \r\nCapacity building and technical assistance to countries to develop effective HIV/AIDS surveillance are main areas of work. \r\nSpecifically, the Knowledge Hub provides 18 different training modules in HIV/AIDS surveillance along with development of new training modules and teaching materials, and consultancies to the countries in development and implementation of HIV/AIDS surveillance.","output_id":"00051458","output_title":"Knowldge Hub on HIV/AIDS"}],"project_descr":"HIV/AIDS UN Coordination","project_id":"00039182","project_title":"HIV/AIDS UN Coordination","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2005-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00039182","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.11972","lon":"15.24222","name":"Zadar, Croatia","outputID":"00050409","output_locID":"00050409-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00039182","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"44.11972","lon":"15.24222","name":"Zadar, Croatia","outputID":"00051458","output_locID":"00051458-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"}]}
