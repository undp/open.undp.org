By adding the '+' to REDD, the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks is emphasized, being identified as essential to achieve the goal of reduced emissions. The REDD+ mechanism is a mechanism to create incentives to protect, better manage and wisely use forest resources, in line with the global fight against climate change. However, reducing emissions from the forest sector does come with a cost, especially in countries with good forest management history such as Malaysia. This project aims at developing a national framework that includes the policy, legal and institutional components for REDD+, exploring and providing recommendations on sustainable financing mechanism for REDD+ implementation, as well as improving capacity and stakeholder participation in REDD+ management. These three outputs will be essential in contribute to the formulation of the National REDD+ Strategy, which will aim at enhancing conservation of natural forest and reduce forest degradation.  The framework will be built upon on-going best practices being undertaken in managing the forest, and will enable decision makers to take informed decisions related to REDD+ based on national and international circumstances, taking various costs and benefits into consideration. Activities carried out through this project must 'do no harm', and contribute to improving livelihoods.","output_id":"00080482","output_title":"Reduced Emission"}],"project_descr":"Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus Readiness in Malaysia","project_id":"00063260","project_title":"Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Degradation","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00063260","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"2.5","lon":"112.5","name":"Malaysia","outputID":"00080482","output_locID":"00080482-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
