The project will also contribute to climate stabilization by reducing or avoiding CO2 emissions in the order of 423,000 tonnes of CO2 (over a 10-year period). The indirect CO2 emission reduction due to replication is an estimated 2 million tCO2 -equivalent over a ten year period. The project will contribute to increasing use of sustainable transport modes by increasing the annual number of person trips on sustainable transport modes promoted under the project by 20%. The legacy of apartheid in South Africa has resulted in a dispersed pattern of land use, with lower-income residents living far from the town centres and other employment nodes in either townships or ex-homelands. On the other hand, it created excellent urban road networks, especially to serve the wealthier suburbs. The combination of these two factors has created a powerful momentum for increasing car use by middle and higher-income groups. As incomes amongst all races rise in South Africa, private car use is anticipated to likewise rise.","output_id":"00055675","output_title":"PIMS 3276 FSP Transport 2010"}],"project_descr":"Sustainable Public Transport and Sport, a 2010 Opportunity","project_id":"00046647","project_title":"PIMS 3276 FSP Transport 2010","region_id":"RBA","start":"2007-03-02","subnational":[{"awardID":"00046647","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"-29","lon":"24","name":"South Africa","outputID":"00055675","output_locID":"00055675-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
