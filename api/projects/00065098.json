UNDP in general and GPPS in particular have been and will continue to be one of the most active partners of the iKNOWPolitics Consortium, which consists of IDEA, IPU, NDI, UNDP and UNIFEM. GPPS will continue to contribute to iKNOWPolitics initiatives and will actively mainstream gender into the program activities.  \r\nPolicy decisions on iKP and policy guidance to the iKP Project Manager is being provided by the iKP Steering Committee, which includes representatives of the five organizations. Project implementation support is being provided by the GPPS Programme Manager. \r\nDuring GPPS III, iKNOWPolitics will continue to work to enable access to valuable resources and advisory services, share interests and experiences, and cooperate on issues of interest to women in politics. During GPPS III, an Arabic language version will be added to the network, in addition to the existing versions in English, French and Spanish. The website will provide free resources through the online library, consolidate expert responses, and publish articles and more.  \r\nDuring GPPS III, iKNOWPolitics will address its increased demand through a series of outreach and sustainability activities globally.  The outreach and sustainability activities would entail: equipping the four iKNOW Regional Coordinators based in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa to exchange best practices and experiences among women in politics, grassroots organizations, and sectors with limited access to technology within their respective regions; conducting meetings to raise awareness about the site; linking with other online platforms; and incorporating new innovative technologies that meet the users' different learning styles, such as a pilot Electronic Learning (E-Learning) project. \r\nThis programme component has secured funding from the Norwegian Government for 2009  2010; with additional contributions from the own resources of the five partner organizations.","output_id":"00072406","output_title":"IKnow Politics"},{"award_id":"00065098","budget":[1157105.0,1343891.0],"crs":"15140","crs_descr":"Government administration","donor_id":["00061"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF BELGIUM"],"donor_short":["BEL"],"expenditure":[862614.0,942871.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Political parties and parliaments are important actors in a transition to democracy, to prevent conflict and to address fragility; they play a particularly critical role in rebuilding trust and reconnecting citizen's - state society relationship in such environments, therefore supporting political settlements and reducing the potential for renewed conflict. The fall of the different regimes in the Arab region has proven that population's inclusive participation in decision making processes through inclusive and effective democratic institutions to be essential, even when economic development seems to be strong but unfortunately not shared with the (entire) population. \r\nThere is clearly a need for more inclusiveness in the work of parliaments and political parties as democratic institutions, a need to strengthen the representativeness of the assemblies as well as a necessity to rebuild citizens' trust in state institutions and their ability to improve citizens' lives.   Engaging with parliaments and political parties on a neutral manner will help foster inclusive political and economic participation and rebuild resilient state-society relations and prevent conflict. This project is seen as a new approach to UNDP's work on political process reform through an integrated approach to support to parliaments and political parties in select Arab States through joint support from BDP / DGG parliamentary development team and the BCPR crisis & governance team. . The outputs will meet important milestones for parliaments and political parties that have the structure, legal framework and capacity to engage all citizens in the political process and are able to be positive actors in preventing conflict.","output_id":"00081722","output_title":"Inclusive and Participative Po"}],"project_descr":"Inclusive","project_id":"00065098","project_title":"Inclusive and Participative Political Institutions","region_id":"global","start":"2012-02-15","subnational":[{"awardID":"00065098","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00072406","output_locID":"00072406-1","precision":"","type":""},{"awardID":"00065098","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00081722","output_locID":"00081722-1","precision":"","type":""}]}
