UNDP Georgia's Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy 2008-2010 (February 2009) proved useful in guiding the first phase of the project by working through communities at risk, scientific institutions, and international organizations to encourage policy change towards a proactive and preventive risk management approach.\r\nThe most significant achievements included a) Development of UN Georgia's Contingency Plan based on a multi-hazard, all-phase approach in collaboration with UN emergency planners, and b) Inclusion of DRR in the new UNDAF 2011-2015, based on the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, and in the corresponding UNDP CPD 2011-2015.\r\nThe key conceptual challenge remains to change the focus from response and preparedness to prevention and mitigation. Another key challenge is to broaden the civil defence disaster management approach and focus on publicly known risk scenarios, humanitarian issues and collaboration with communities and civil society.\r\nThe overall objective of the second phase is to make DRR a national, regional and local priority with an established, strong institutional basis for implementation. This will be accomplished by focusing on three outputs: 1) Establishing / strengthening an inclusive and functional National Platform for DRR, 2) Mainstreaming DRR in development policies, programmes, and practices, and 3) Enhancing disaster risk management and coordination with a special focus on humanitarian issues.","output_id":"00076510","output_title":"DRR System Phase 2"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening of the Disaster Risk Reduction System in Georgia","project_id":"00049835","project_title":"Disaster Risk Reduction System (DRR) in Georgia","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2008-09-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049835","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"41.69411","lon":"44.83368","name":"City of Tbilisi","outputID":"00076510","output_locID":"00076510-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
