While primarily dealing with issues related to and stemming from the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the project will also provide a preventive support element to UNDP's efforts to support Georgia's complex and conflict-prone democratic transition process, with particular regard to the critical 2012-2013 national elections.  The project will strengthen national mechanisms for dialogue, local peace leadership and conflict resolution capacities by facilitating direct connectivity among and between the affected local communities, relevant authorities and key international actors.","output_id":"00084270","output_title":"PDP-Phase 2"}],"project_descr":"The objective of the project is to support the RC and UNDP to lead international efforts in Georgia on conflict prevention, post-conflict recovery, and peace and development initiatives.","project_id":"00070082","project_title":"Peace and Development Program - Phase 2","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2013-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00070082","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"41.69411","lon":"44.83368","name":"City of Tbilisi","outputID":"00084270","output_locID":"00084270-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
