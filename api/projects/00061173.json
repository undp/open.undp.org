More specifically, UNDP will be responsible for the monitoring of air quality in major urban cities and hotspots, and the identification of reduction opportunities.\r\nThis project will involve the initiation of an air quality programme that will be in accordance with the proposed Lebanon Clean Air Act. The work will build capacity amongst government agencies and key stakeholder's (e.g. major industrial installations) in terms of air quality monitoring.  Moreover, the Project will provide an initial feedback to decision makers on the state of air quality in urban areas and increase awareness of the general public in terms of ambient air through air quality display boards and a website.  It will also provide the collated data to develop policy recommendations with the aim of reducing air pollution in the urban areas.","output_id":"00077384","output_title":"Air pollution"}],"project_descr":"Environmental Resources Monitoring in Lebanon (national comp)","project_id":"00061173","project_title":"Environmental Resources Monitoring Leb (national comp)","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2011-02-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061173","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"33.88894","lon":"35.49442","name":"Lebanon","outputID":"00077384","output_locID":"00077384-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
