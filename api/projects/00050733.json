Building on the success of the UNDP \"Performance, Professionalism, Pride\" project implemented with the Pol\u00edcia da Rep\u00fablica de Mozambique (PRM), this proposed project will support the development of law enforcement and military bodies' capacity to provide effective Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) control of civilian and government owned weapons. This will not only reduce the perceived need of civilian firearms possession for protection, but also limit the ability of criminals to perpetrate armed crime without penalty. It will thus increase the population's confidence in governmental capacity to enforce the law and the security of the population in terms of arms storage. \r\n\r\nThe 2008-11 SALW MA integrated programme has been developed to support national and local capacities response to the challenges that stockpiled ammunitions, firearms and contamination from landmines and ERW continue to pose to Human Security and Human Development in Mozambique.  The SALW Programme will take place over three years and includes the following major outputs:\r\n\r\n1.\tEnhance government capacity to safely manage stockpiled munitions\r\n2.\tEnhance government capacity to meet its obligations under the AP Mine Ban Treaty and addresses residual threats posed by other ERW\r\n3.\tEnhance government capacity to manage and control firearms ownership\r\n4.\tUNDP delivers a coordinated response to the landmines, small arms and armed violence problems\r\n\r\nThe SALW Programme will be implemented through the National Execution (NEX) modality, involving a two implementing partners including: the Ministry of Interior (Police) and the Ministry of Defence as well as selected international and national NGOs.","output_id":"00062798","output_title":"Small Arms & Light Weapons Con"}],"project_descr":"Weapons Risk Mitigation and Mainstreaming Mine Action, Small Arms & Light Weapons Controls","project_id":"00050733","project_title":"Weapons Risk Mitigation:Mine Action & Small Arms Control","region_id":"RBA","start":"2008-08-26","subnational":[{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-12.5","lon":"39.4","name":"Cabo Delgado","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-25.05194","lon":"33.64417","name":"Gaza","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-23.865","lon":"35.38333","name":"Inhambane","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-3","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-25.96553","lon":"32.58322","name":"Maputo","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-4","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-15.11646","lon":"39.2666","name":"Nampula","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-5","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-13.31278","lon":"35.24056","name":"Niassa","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-6","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-19.84361","lon":"34.83889","name":"Sofala","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-7","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"-17.87861","lon":"36.88833","name":"Zambezia","outputID":"00062797","output_locID":"00062797-8","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00050733","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"-25.96553","lon":"32.58322","name":"Maputo","outputID":"00062798","output_locID":"00062798-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
