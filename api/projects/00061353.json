Specifically the MAF showed that while the country was implementing rural water systems projects nationally, there was insufficient institutional and technical capacity to sustain quality water coverage through community engagement processes. Improved sanitation coverage remains slow due to the absence of the facilitation and coordination by an identified lead agency which often leads to ad hoc communication and awareness support to communities especially those in rural areas.  This project will implement some of the critical measures identified during the pilot and will make the MAF operational in Belize. This project will institutionalize democratic governance practices in rural water and sanitation service delivery while building leadership capacities within the Ministry of Local Government to improve the coordination and performance of local water boards and the communities in which they operate.","output_id":"00077697","output_title":"MDG Water Governance  Project"}],"project_descr":"Applying MDG Acceleration Framework: Addressing Governance Bottlenecks to Achieve Water and Sanitation Coverage in Belize","project_id":"00061353","project_title":"MDG Water Governance  Project","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2011-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061353","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"17.25","lon":"-88.75","name":"Belize","outputID":"00077697","output_locID":"00077697-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
