This joint initiative harnesses the skills and strengths of UNDP, UNICEF and ILO, structuring the activities around the following results areas:\r\n\r\ni.\tCapacity for peace and human security established in target districts under recognized legal and institutional frameworks in support to the selection and demilitarization process of 2000 youth and adolescent (UNDP);\r\nii.\tAn estimated 700 adolescents, from within the profiled 2000 youth, demobilized and reintegrated at community level (UNICEF);\r\niii.\tImplementation of at least four DSC creating at least 1,300 short-term job opportunities for youth to contribute to violence reduction activities, community development and public works projects for initial employment and reintegration community (ILO);\r\niv.\tWomen, youth and marginalized groups are empowered to contribute meaningfully to safety and security decision-making (UNDP);\r\nv.\tAvenues created for longer term job creation/enterprise development through vocational training (based on labor and enterprise survey), youth entrepreneurship training and related business skills development. 100 new businesses started linking to business incubators (ILO).\r\n\r\nThe overall programme addresses short term violence and insecurity at district level while delivering longer-term reform in community security. The combined action of the components above shall strengthen the Somali peacebuilding infrastructure which enables the Somali people to address and support a broader range of issues including this initiative on youth at-risk but also other ongoing programmes to address human trafficking and piracy. By engaging with actors of violence, youth at-risk or associated with armed groups, the potential to prevent youth enlistment in violent activities will also be addressed. Furthermore, such a joint venture maximizes co-ordination and coherence, building the basis for sustainable impact by establishing a strategic partnership based on comparative advantage of UN agencies and partner NGOs.\r\n\r\nThe programme builds on work already undertaken by each of the participating agency within their respective mandates. More specifically, it builds on the success of the LSBE programme implemented jointly by UNICEF and ILO with a previous grant from the donor.\r\n\r\nThe proposed strategic approach to violence and conflict reduction is in line with the recent discussions within the UN on how to undertake \"second generation of DDR\" in complex settings, like the Somali one, where the minimum conditions for implementing traditional DDR programmes are not in place and there are high levels of diffused violence perpetrated by armed elements, such as militias and gangs.","output_id":"00078475","output_title":"YOUTH AT RISK PROJECT"},{"award_id":"00058616","budget":[300000.0],"crs":"15210","crs_descr":"Security system management and reform","donor_id":["00012"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions"],"donor_short":["UNDP"],"expenditure":[93925.0],"fiscal_year":["2013"],"focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":null,"output_id":"00083614","output_title":"Youth Empowerment"},{"award_id":"00058616","budget":[4100176.0,1960430.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_id":["00141"],"donor_name":["GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN"],"donor_short":["JPN"],"expenditure":[3148953.0,1939031.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Budget Revision  done to carry over  $ 745568 Japanese Funds (Youth for  Change)  from 2013 to 2014","output_id":"00083857","output_title":"Youth for Change Project"}],"project_descr":"Renamed The Community Security Project, it supports the Somali government authorities in the development and implementation of key National Peacebuilding and Community Security Policies and the development of alternative sentencing guidelines.","project_id":"00058616","project_title":"DDR/ARMED VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROJECT IN SOMALIA","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2009-11-13","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058616","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"2.03711","lon":"45.34375","name":"Somalia","outputID":"00072870","output_locID":"00072870-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00058616","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"2.03711","lon":"45.34375","name":"Somalia","outputID":"00078475","output_locID":"00078475-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00058616","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"2.03711","lon":"45.34375","name":"Somalia","outputID":"00083614","output_locID":"00083614-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"},{"awardID":"00058616","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"2.03711","lon":"45.34375","name":"Somalia","outputID":"00083857","output_locID":"00083857-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
