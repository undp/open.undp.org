These\r\nobjectives aim to address significant gaps in the following areas:\r\n1. Institutional framework and organisational capacity of the IHEC as Iraq\u201fs permanent electoral\r\ninstitution, established under the constitution;\r\n2. Human resource capacity of the IHEC (staff skills, knowledge and resources) at both central and\r\ngovernorate office levels;\r\n3. Technological capacity to manage electoral processes in a sustainable manner.\r\nThe programme will be implemented through strong partnerships between the IHEC and the various UN\r\nentities mandated and experienced in the sector of electoral support to Iraq. The successful implementation of\r\nprogramme activities is expected to contribute significantly to the achievement of outcomes prioritised in the\r\nUNCT\u201fs Assistance Strategy 2008-2011 and the UN Development Assistance Framework 2011-2014.\"","output_id":"00076645","output_title":"Institutional Development IHEC"}],"project_descr":"Institutional Development Support to the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC)","project_id":"00060760","project_title":"Institutional Development Support to IHEC","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2010-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060760","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"33","lon":"44","name":"Iraq","outputID":"00076645","output_locID":"00076645-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
