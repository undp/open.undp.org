As recommended by BCPR as post-conflict best practice, the project focuses on vulnerable groups, but does not exclude other community members. Since community-based funds are not feasible for UNDP as per its global Microfinance guidelines, the project proposes microgrants for individual inexperienced youths/women (or teams of youths/women), individual or group loans for more experienced, but maybe illiterate community members, as well as ASCA-Sanduq  trainings for self-selected sanduq groups at community-levels.Thus the proposed project is focussing on three different categories of beneficiaries:\r\n\u2022\tCommunity micro-enterprise capacity development: The project will attempt to introduce a systematic element of volunteerism into rural community development in Sudan, as volunteers can be a valuable addition to any rural development project and increase the impact of their interventions in a cost-effective way. In this system, the volunteers will act as community agents with the specific role of social mobilisers, brokers and facilitators for the youth and others in the communities, with the clear focus on the youth's role and contribution to the rural community's economic empowerment. \r\n\u2022\tJob creation in communities as a consequence of capacity development: It is expected that beyond the community members actually trained by the volunteers, other community members can also benefit from the job opportunities that would result from the creation of new businessesand strengthened value chains e.g. honey, sheep, groundnuts and hibiscus tea.\r\n\u2022\tUnemployed young graduates: The project aims to enhance the capacities of the young graduate volunteers regarding economic development in order to access gainful employment as a future microfinance loan officers or as professional staff with a development organization, the civil service or alternatively to set up their own small businesses. On the other hand, the project will attempt to increase the capacity of the economically active poor in rural communities to establish or expand their own business and increase market access with a special attention to youth, women and other vulnerable groups.In view of the fact that the Government of Sudan requires youth between the ages of 18-32 to perform a mandatory one-year national service, the project, through discussions with the relevant authorities, will attempt to include this national volunteer's scheme into the mandatory national civil service, thus saving valuable time for the participating young graduate volunteers.\t\r\n\r\nThe volunteers will dedicate their efforts for 9 months periods, taking permanent residence in the target community, bring new skills and experiences to the community and will be keen to learn and participate in training opportunities. They can be representatives of the rural users they are working with and can be a great link between outside businesses and the communities they serve. Volunteers are often full of enthusiasm, and if they have the correct support structures in place, they can bring a breath of fresh air and a new perspective to their communities. Young people make excellent volunteers and they often have many skills and energy to offer to their communities, but to make the most of their efforts, they must have clear roles and professional support.","output_id":"00079800","output_title":"Youth Volunteers Rebuild Darfu"},{"award_id":"00046028","budget":[1594371.0,1136034.0,1000000.0],"crs":"73010","crs_descr":"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation","donor_id":["10480"],"donor_name":["UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID)"],"donor_short":["USAID"],"expenditure":[1584267.0,369596.0,null],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"Pro-poor value chain integration for peace and early recovery in Darfur (Phase I)","output_id":"00080789","output_title":"Pro-Poor VCI (USAID Component)"},{"award_id":"00046028","budget":[498176.0,479743.0],"crs":"15210","crs_descr":"Security system management and reform","donor_id":["10714"],"donor_name":["UNDP AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR A JOINT PROGRAMME PASS THROUGH ARRANGEMENT"],"donor_short":["UNDP(JPAA)"],"expenditure":[459530.0,112707.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012"],"focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"The overall objective of the Darfur Community Recovery for Coexistence (DCRC) project is to facilitate dialogue for coexistence and reconciliation between the 1) IDP host communities, 2) IDP communities and 3) communities of return.
