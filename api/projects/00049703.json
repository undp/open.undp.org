Further more this project wil support the government in securing that additional capacity in a more cost effective and economically responsible manner, and therefore in a more politically sustainable manner. In so doing the project will avoid 402,360 to 536,480 CO2 eq in GHG emissions over the 20 year life of the new small hydro generating facilities. The project will do this by supporting the government of Montenegro in: i) streamlining and simplifying the application procedures for small renewable independent power producers; ii) collecting basic data to make investment decisions; iii) by setting attractive but competitive business terms and conditions for investors; iv) and helping the new Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Unit role out a streamlined and transparent tendering process.","output_id":"00060829","output_title":"Small Hydropower development"}],"project_descr":"To reduce emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) by promoting the development of small hydropower resources in Montenegro","project_id":"00049703","project_title":"Small Hydro Development in MNE","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2008-03-17","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049703","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"42.44111","lon":"19.26361","name":"Podgorica, Montenegro","outputID":"00060829","output_locID":"00060829-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
