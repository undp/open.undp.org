This project will demonstrate  a widely replicable,  integrated approach  to the protection  and sustainable  use of biodiversity  on private  lands  to mitigate  this default scenario and secure global benefits through the conservation  of native and endemic floral and faunal species in forested areas and soils. Project outputs will include a greater emphasis on biodiversity  protection  in ecological-economic  zoning and the identification  of high biodiversity areas  for  protection.   There  will  also  be  strengthened   municipal   planning,   development   of supportive policies and instruments, and monitoring through the incorporation of biodiversity conservation values. The project will help to remove barriers to the adoption of systems, practices and management  techniques  that integrate non-timber  forest products and mitigate unsustainable pressures on biologically diverse habitats.","output_id":"00011666","output_title":"BRA/00/G31 Biodiv Conservation"}],"project_descr":"Promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable use in the frontier forests of Northwestern Mato Grosso","project_id":"00011666","project_title":"BRA/00/G31 Biodivers Conservation Northwest Mato Grosso","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2000-10-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00011666","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"-13","lon":"56","name":"Mato Grosso","outputID":"00011666","output_locID":"00011666-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
