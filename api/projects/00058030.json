The objective is to extend coverage of the annual Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic GHGs to period 2000-2010, focusing on the sectors/gases that have a significant share of GHG emissions and/or present a large degree of data uncertainty. New integrated global model for climate change studies and downscaling of global models will be developed to reduce the uncertainties in V&A assessments for different sectors. Brazil's description of national circumstances will be updated, as well as the steps to be taken or envisaged to implement the Convention. Finally, the project will continue to build institutional capacity for implementing the Convention in Brazil including undertaking activities related to climate change education and awareness.","output_id":"00071915","output_title":"BRA10G32-3rd National Communic"}],"project_descr":"BRA/10/G32 - Third National Communication to the UNFCCC","project_id":"00058030","project_title":"BRA/10/G32 - Third National Communication to the UNFCCC","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2010-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058030","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"-10","lon":"-55","name":"Brazil","outputID":"00071915","output_locID":"00071915-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
