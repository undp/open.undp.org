Frustration about the lack of means to change their futures is high and can have dangerous implications to Kosovo's socio-political stability considering also the large scale corruption in the public sector.  Unless Kosovo's government becomes more efficient, transparent and accountable, citizens will still have little faith in its young democracy. Socio-political exclusion continues to be widespread, eroding quality of life along ethnic, age and gender divides. \r\n\r\nAt the local policy level, this project will promote modern communication tools, such as social media and SMS, to widen the outreach capacities of two selected municipalities, make them more responsive to youth needs and increase their dialogue with young women and men. Activities will include, but are not limited to, conducting a participatory situation analysis to identify the key business problems faced by the target municipalities and supporting the municipalities in establishing innovative social media prototype solutions to tackle these. The project will also deliver trainings and provide consultation services to municipality staff on effectively using social media, supporting also the organization of outreach activities to youth through such modern communication tools.\r\n\r\nAt the grassroots level, it will support the use of social media tools and SMS to strengthen the voice and participation of young women and men in local decision making and governance monitoring, contributing as such to more transparency and accountability. To this aim, the project will assist youth CSOs in identifying key business problems faced by the target municipalities and support youth CSOs in developing social media prototype solutions to tackle them. Besides implementing training activities and providing mentoring services to youth CSOs, the project will be supporting youth CSOs in organizing social mobilization campaigns though social media and SMS to engage more young people in municipal decision making and monitoring.","output_id":"00082707","output_title":"Social Media&Local Empowerment"}],"project_descr":"Using social media to increase public sector transparency and accountability and enhance citizen's participation in local decision making and monitoring.","project_id":"00066550","project_title":"Social Media for Innovative Local   Empowerment","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2012-04-27","subnational":[{"awardID":"00066550","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"42.67272","lon":"21.16688","name":"Pristina, Kosovo","outputID":"00082707","output_locID":"00082707-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
