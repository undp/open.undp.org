The vast wetlands serve as the migratory endpoint for birds and are used by many rare and endangered species. The area is threatened by encroaching development and mismanagement and efforts are required for the conservation and sustainable use of it globally significant biodiversity across the tundra landscape that makes up the Central Taimyr Landscape Corridor (CTLC). The project proposes to engage stakeholders in devising innovative and adaptive practices to mitigate and prevent threats to biological diversity by applying new partnerships, conservation tools, information, and sustainable livelihoods to conserve biological diversity. In particular, the project will ensure that \r\ni) Biodiversity conservation and sustainable use objectives are mainstreamed into existing sectoral policies and practice.\r\nii) Landscape-scale biodiversity conservation programs are operationalized in central Taimyr.\r\niii) Information is shared, traditional knowledge is preserved, and awareness is increased regarding conservation of the Taimyr Peninsula's biodiversity.","output_id":"00048248","output_title":"PIMS 1816 BD MSP:Taimyr Biodiv"}],"project_descr":"Conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Russia's Taymir Peninsula: maintaining connectivity across the landscape","project_id":"00042144","project_title":"Taimyr Biodiversity Conservation","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2005-11-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00042144","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"60","lon":"100","name":"Russia","outputID":"00048248","output_locID":"00048248-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
