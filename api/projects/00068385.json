The procedure of the rehabilitation is \"Landfill Mining\" which includes a treatment of excavated waste at site to produce secondary construction material complying with local and EU standards. To enable rehabilitation of the Saida landfill, acceptance of waste will have to cease at the moment the rehabilitation starts. Daily incoming municipal solid waste will be transported to and processed at an alternative facility.  \n\nThe project will be implemented with the Ministry of the Environment and will be coordinated very closely with the municipality of Saida.","output_id":"00083622","output_title":"Rehabilitation of Saida Dump"}],"project_descr":"The Rehabilitation of Saida Dumpsite","project_id":"00068385","project_title":"The Rehabilitation of Saida Dumpsite","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2012-09-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00068385","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"33.55993","lon":"35.37564","name":"Saida","outputID":"00083622","output_locID":"00083622-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"}]}
