The aim of this project is to mainstream migratory soaring bird considerations into the productive sectors along the flyway that pose the greatest risk to the safe migration of these birds  principally hunting, energy, agriculture and waste management  while promoting activities in sectors which could benefit from these birds, such as ecotourism. The project will pilot a new, innovative and cost-effective approach, termed \"double-mainstreaming\", that seeks to integrate flyway issues into existing national or donor-funded \"vehicles\" of reform or change management in the key sectors through the provision of technical tools, content, services and support.","output_id":"00060017","output_title":"Migratory Soaring Birds-Jordan"}],"project_descr":"Mainstreaming Conservation of Migratory Soaring Birds into Key Productive Sectors Along the Rift Valley/Red Sea flyway","project_id":"00049295","project_title":"Soaring Birds - National","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2008-02-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00049295","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"31.95522","lon":"35.94503","name":"Amman","outputID":"00060017","output_locID":"00060017-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"}]}
