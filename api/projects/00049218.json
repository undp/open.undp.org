Somalia has been in a state of anarchy, ruled by power of arms of warlords and clan leaders, following the collapse of the Siyad Barre regime in 1991. The UN estimates that there are 370,000- 400,000 IDPs in Somalia today representing more than 5% of the total population of 6.8 million. These form a group of chronically vulnerable people who lack even the most basic protection and essential services. Conditions are among the worst in Africa. There are about 35,000 IDPs in Puntland of which 22,000 in Bossaso, a coastal town with high exposure to human security challenges.\n\nThe proposed project will apply the UN Joint UN Strategy to Address the Needs of IDPs in Somalia in assisting IDPs in Bossaso and provide:\n1)\tBetter protection for IDPs in temporary and permanent settlements, as evidenced by protection of human rights,  against physical violence, and against fire\n2)\tImproved living conditions in existing and temporary settlements, as evidenced by an upgrade of temporary settlements, improved access to basic services, and access to immediate income generating opportunities by implementation through community works schemes\n3)\tDurable solutions for livelihoods, resettlement and reintegration, as evidenced by local resettlement and integration solutions in Bossaso as well as resettlement and integration solutions in alternative rural and coastal locations.\n\nThe project has been conceived as a Joint Programme by five implementing UN partners and is levered by recently strengthened UN capacities for field-based coordination of humanitarian assistance. A Joint Programme Manager will coordinate implementation and ensure delivery on targets.\n\nOngoing or completed efforts within UNDP, which will facilitate the implementation of the proposed project, are:\nUNDP\u2019s Reintegration of Returning Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons Programme (RRIDP) has carried out an assessment of vulnerable populations including IDPs and returnees in Bossaso, which has guided the analysis of priority needs and socio-economic characteristics. In collaboration with the Municipality and local NGOs, RRIDP has focused on livelihood development through the construction of markets and provision of micro-credit. \n\nThe RRIDP programme has established a participatory approach to consensus-building in all stages of the project cycle, which will be applied to the UNTFHS-funded components.\n\nUNDP has also supported the training of IDP chairpersons and, through its Rule of Law and Security Programme (ROLS), improved security of settlements through construction of a police station.",
