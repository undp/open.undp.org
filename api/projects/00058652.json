Each year, it notified an average of 150 cases of all forms of tuberculosis. In 2006, the WHO estimated the incidence and prevalence of cases of all forms to be 103 and 252 per 100,000 population respectively, and the incidence of smear-positive (S+) cases at 46 per 100,000. For the same year, 153 cases of all forms of TB were notified including 36 S+ cases for an S+ PTB detection rate of 50%. For the 2005 cohort of S+ pulmonary TB cases (49 cases), the recovery rate was 98% (1 death notified, representing 2%). First cases of HIV/AIDS in the country were notified in 1989. HIV prevalence is estimated at 1.5% (source: 2005 National AIDS Program study on prevalence of HIV among pregnant women). HIV prevalence among TB patients increased rapidly from 1.9% in 2006 to 8.6% in 2007 (source: National AIDS and TB Programs). Since 2006, multi-drug resistant TB cases (MDR-TB) have been registered based on clinical diagnosis. Currently four MDR-TB patients have been identified of which three are under treatment. The program aims to reduce tuberculosis morbidity and mortality in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe by improving and expanding effective DOTS strategy implementation, fighting TB/HIV co-infection and MDR-TB, and by giving persons suffering from TB and their communities the ability to take action. It will contribute to establish in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe a functional NTBP capable of implementing the DOTS strategy as stated in the country's National Anti-TB Policy and Strategic Plan for 2007-2011. The Strategic Plan is currently being evaluated and a new Strategy will be adopted by October 2012.","output_id":"00072957","output_title":"National Tuberculose Response"}],"project_descr":"Reinforcement of the national Tuberculose response in Sao Tom\u00e9 and Principe","project_id":"00058652","project_title":"TUBERCULOSE RESPONSE","region_id":"RBA","start":"2009-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00058652","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"0.33333","lon":"6.66667","name":"Madalena","outputID":"00072957","output_locID":"00072957-1","precision":"3","type":"PPL"},{"awardID":"00058652","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"0.32","lon":"6.69","name":"Naves","outputID":"00072957","output_locID":"00072957-2","precision":"3","type":"PPL"}]}
