The print media in particular, is hampered by the lack of basic technology and access to such simple tools as computers, tape recorders, office furniture and stationery. Newsprint is expensive; the five printing presses in Freetown are expected to handle over 20 papers daily and distribution is in the hands of the Newspaper Vendors' Association who exercise enormous influence over the content of papers, particularly the front pages.
