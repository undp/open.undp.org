The programme has three areas: 1) Promoting public policies for strengthening the rule of law and the MDGs, using three indicators systems; 2) Institutional development of the criminal justice and penal systems and general security, based on local analyses; and 3) Strengthening local and state capacities for the reduction and non-violent resolution of conflicts and the construction of a culture of peace.","output_id":"00064022","output_title":"Prevenci\u00f3n  de conflictos"}],"project_descr":"Prevenci\u00f3n  de conflictos, desarrollo de acuerdos y construcci\u00f3n de la paz \r\nen comunidades con personas internamente desplazadas en Chiapas, M\u00e9xico (2009-2011)","project_id":"00051425","project_title":"MDG-F Prevenci\u00f3n  de conflictos en Chiapas","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2008-12-17","subnational":[{"awardID":"00051425","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"16.5","lon":"-92.5","name":"Chiapas","outputID":"00064022","output_locID":"00064022-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
