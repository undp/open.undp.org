UNDP Iraq has also been nominated as PR for the TB grant approved to Iraq under 9th round of GFATM call for proposals. The GFATM modified their funding architecture through consolidation of different overlapping grants for the same disease component. Hence in October 2010, UNDP and the GAFTM has signed a consolidated grant agreement, merging the remaining of grant agreement number IRQ-607-G01-T and the new grant approved under round 9. This project document is prepared to reflect the changes to the original project document approved entitled \"Strengthening TB control in Iraq particularly among poor and vulnerable populations\" for the project 56801.  As a result of the consolidation of the two grants, the first grant activities should be closed by 30th September 2010, new consolidated grant activities to start from 1st October 2010 till 31st December 2012. Most of the activities initially planned for the last quarter of 2010 under the consolidated agreement need to be implemented in 2011 since the first disbursement under the SSF agreement was disbursed late in December 2010. In addition this project document will support the national HIV/AIDS control program through support to the development of 5 years national strategic plan and resources mobilization efforts from the GFATM and other potential donors.","output_id":"00056801","output_title":"Support to TB and HIV Programs"}],"project_descr":"Enhanced Capacity of Government of Iraq  to address TB and HIV/AIDS including the delivery and usage of GFATM resources","project_id":"00047321","project_title":"Support to National TB and HIV/AIDS control Programs","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2007-05-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00047321","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"33","lon":"44","name":"Iraq","outputID":"00056801","output_locID":"00056801-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
