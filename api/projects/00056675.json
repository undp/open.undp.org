Capacity development of key national institutions including civil society organisations (CSOs) will be a strategic focus for UNDP, in line with the cross-cutting strategic focus of the CPAP.\n\n7.\tThe project will provide rule of law and judicial reform services under the state capacity and institutional strengthening component of the CPAP's Democratic Governance programmatic pillar. This pillar contributes to achieving UNDAF Outcome 3, \"Democratic, accountable and transparent governance is being advanced in a participatory and inclusive manner and in accordance with human rights standards.\" Specific emphasis will be placed on supporting the building of a democratic governance system through institutions and processes responsive to the needs of Liberian citizens, especially the poor and marginalised.","output_id":"00069513","output_title":"Rule of Law and administration"}],"project_descr":"UNDP's support strategy for strengthening the rule of law and administration of justice  in Liberia","project_id":"00056675","project_title":"Rule of Law and administration of Justice-BCPR","region_id":"RBA","start":"2009-02-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00056675","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"5.88083","lon":"-10.04667","name":"Buchanan","outputID":"00069513","output_locID":"00069513-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00056675","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"4.375","lon":"-7.71694","name":"Harper","outputID":"00069513","output_locID":"00069513-2","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00056675","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"6.30054","lon":"-10.7969","name":"Monrovia","outputID":"00069513","output_locID":"00069513-3","precision":"3","type":"PPLC"},{"awardID":"00056675","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"6.06667","lon":"-8.12806","name":"Zwedru","outputID":"00069513","output_locID":"00069513-4","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00056675","focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","lat":"6.06667","lon":"-8.12806","name":"Grand Gedeh County","outputID":"00069513","output_locID":"00069513-5","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
