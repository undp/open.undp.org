The activities proposed in the project are designed to remove barriers that hamper the wide-scale implementation of renewable energy technologies. The Government of Lesotho (GoL) objective as stated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy is to increase the electrification targets from the current 8% to at least 35% by 2020, country wide. Since the geography of Lesotho does not lend itself to extensive extension of the national electricity grid, renewable energy sources are excellent alternatives to reaching this target.\nThe project will assist in the development of a renewable energy market in the remote rural areas of the country and facilitate the use of renewable energy for productive uses","output_id":"00049143","output_title":"Renewable Energy in Lesotho"}],"project_descr":"The project aims at reducing Lesotho's energy related CO2 emissions by promoting renewable and low Green House Gases (GHG) technologies as a substitute for fossil fuels utilised in rural areas of the country.","project_id":"00042547","project_title":"Renewable Energy Rural Electrification in Lesotho","region_id":"RBA","start":"2006-09-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00042547","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"-29.21667","lon":"29.03333","name":"Mokhotlong","outputID":"00049143","output_locID":"00049143-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
