The DRM PSD is in line with the MGDS-II, United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and CPD priorities. The Malawi DRM system is in a transition phase from a disaster management-reactive- approach to a more comprehensive disaster risk management approach. Although progress has been made to establish supporting strategic frameworks and institutional mechanisms, several needs and challenges remain and some of them will be addressed by the PSD of UNDP to better assist the Government of Malawi on key issues of disaster risk management aimed to reduce damage and losses caused by disasters. UNDP therefore aims to support Government of Malawi, through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) in the following  areas: mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and planning processes at all levels of government; the establishment of an effective system to identify, assess and monitor disaster risks under data and information knowledge including early warning systems (EWS's); and strengthening coordination are the main pillars of this Programme Support Document (PSD).","output_id":"00083071","output_title":"Disaster Risk Management Suppo"}],"project_descr":"Under the new 2012-2016 programme cycle, UNDP aims to support Government of Malawi in mainstreaming, knowledge management and coordination for Disaster Risk Management .","project_id":"00067161","project_title":"Disaster Risk Management Support to Malawi (2012-2016)","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-05-28","subnational":[{"awardID":"00067161","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"-13.5","lon":"34","name":"Malawi","outputID":"00083071","output_locID":"00083071-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
