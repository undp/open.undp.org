It will reinforce the local economy by decreasing the dependency of the country on imported fossil fuel and reducing building operation costs for project owners/operators.\nThe project promotes cross-convention synergy by reducing GHG and CFC emissions through improving energy efficiency in buildings.","output_id":"00058719","output_title":"BRA/09/G31: Energy Efficiency"}],"project_descr":"BRA/09/G31 PIMS 3665 CC FSP: Energy Efficiency Buildings","project_id":"00048524","project_title":"BRA/09/G31 - Energy Efficiency in Buildings","region_id":"RBLAC","start":"2010-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00048524","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"-10","lon":"-55","name":"Brazil","outputID":"00058719","output_locID":"00058719-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
