In submitting project proposals, the Country Office should take into account the following:\r\nProjects are selected from all geographical regions. Projects should aim at vulnerable groups and focus on one or several practice areas of UNDP (ideally offices should submit project proposals from various practice areas).\r\nPreferred projects should have a quick impact as well as visible measurable results that will be used to organize new fundraising events. An extension of ongoing projects or \"ready to start\" projects will receive preferential consideration. The Match Against Poverty funding must be clearly identifiable with a specific component and its expected results.  The project proposals should follow the standard UNDP prodoc format. Once a project proposal has been approved by the PAC, the allotment is transferred to the country office. Once the project is completed the country sends a report.Proceeds from the previous eight Matches Against Poverty have benefited projects in more than 27 developing countries, including recent recovery efforts in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods.
