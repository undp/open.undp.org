Most developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, are unable to meet the basic needs of more than half of their population who live in rural communities. lf the current trend continues, most developing countries, especially the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and fragile states may not be able to meet the MDG targets by 2015. Urgent assistance and concerted commitments are required by both governments and development partners to deliver MDG services at the local level, and unlock the institutional bottlenecks that hamper the progress. UNDP and UNCDF propose a global programme and funding mechanism allowing local governments in developing countries to plan, through a participatory process, the specific scalable local responses to the most urgent MDG challenges. ln most countries, the focus will be on one or two MDGs identified by the national governments, in partnership with sub-national governments. Cross-cutting issues such as gender equality and environmental sustainability will be explicitly addressed. ln tandem with significantly increased resources for local service delivery, UNDP and UNCDF will provide assistance for the development of national systems to effectively assist local governments in scaling up delivery. Through this joint programme, UNDP and UNCDF will support the development of national programmes to scale up support for the MDGs at local level in an initial set of about 10 countries in 2010. For the implementation period starting in 2011, the funding can be channeled through a global fund, or through individual country programmes.","output_id":"00080053","output_title":"Scaling Up Local Innovations"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00064402","project_title":"Scaling Up Integrated Local Development Innovations","region_id":"global","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00064402","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"","lon":"","name":"Global","outputID":"00080053","output_locID":"00080053-1","precision":"","type":""}]}
