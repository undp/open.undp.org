Set against this backdrop, the country is poised to initiate activities and measures to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs.  Of prime importance in rallying this initiative is the engagement and empowerment of dutybearers and claimholders in pushing for reforms and appropriate interventions that would address bottlenecks in the achievement of the MDGs from the national to sub-national levels. Showcasing of best practices and lessons learned in MDG mainstreaming shall be pursued through results-based monitoring, advocacy and policy support for local and national initiatives.","output_id":"00081841","output_title":"Accelerating Progress on the M"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00065258","project_title":"Accelerating Progress on the Millennium Development Goal","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2012-02-24","subnational":[{"awardID":"00065258","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"14.58691","lon":"121.0614","name":"Pasig","outputID":"00081841","output_locID":"00081841-1","precision":"3","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00065258","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"18.1978","lon":"120.5957","name":"Ilocos Norte","outputID":"00081841","output_locID":"00081841-2","precision":"4","type":"PPLA2"},{"awardID":"00065258","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"12.35275","lon":"121.06761","name":"Mindoro Occidental","outputID":"00081841","output_locID":"00081841-3","precision":"4","type":"PPL"}]}
