Integrity frameworks remain weak across the region (weakest in Central Asia), to a significant extent due to insufficient focus on corruption prevention. Based on its experience of several years working with anti-corruption agencies and on analysis of current global and regional trends, UNDP BRC has identified a number of key areas for capacity development to leverage genuine improvements in public accountability, transparency and integrity, including: capacity development support to national integrity institutions; corruption assessments and integrity strengthening in public service delivery and in local governments; support to the UNCAC review process through a transparent, participatory and comprehensive approach; advocacy, networking and knowledge facilitation. The project has been designed in close consultation with COs and its implementation will be demand-driven, cultivating programmatic linkages between the regional and country levels for enhanced impact.","output_id":"00078500","output_title":"Strengthening corruption preve"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening corruption prevention capacities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia","project_id":"00061757","project_title":"Strengthening corruption prevention capacities","region_id":"global","start":"2011-04-26","subnational":[{"awardID":"00061757","focus_area":"2","focus_area_descr":"Democratic governance","lat":"48.66667","lon":"19.5","name":"Slovakia","outputID":"00078500","output_locID":"00078500-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
