The immediate objectives are (i) to establish a national strategic plan to build an inclusive financial sector and (ii) to create commercially viable financial institutions that provide access to finance to the lower segments in the market (i.e to poor and low-income households).\r\n\r\nThe project consists of two main components.  \r\n\r\nFirst, multi-stakeholder dialogues and demand based research will be organized to identify and analyze the constraints and opportunities on building an inclusive financial sector. This process will result in a national strategic plan that will act as a road map for joint and coordinated action of all stakeholders in their aim to build an inclusive financial sector in China.\r\n\r\nSecond, an Inclusive Finance Fund will be established to provide technical and financial support to a carefully selected group of entities that show high promise to be able to provide financial services on a commercially viable basis to a large number of poor and low-income households in the rural and less developed areas of China.","output_id":"00047231","output_title":"Inclusive Financial Sector"}],"project_descr":"Inclusive Financial Sector to increase financial access to poor people for Poverty Alleviation","project_id":"00041442","project_title":"Inclusive Financial Sector for Poverty Alleviation","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2005-09-27","subnational":[{"awardID":"00041442","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"45.75","lon":"126.65","name":"Heilongjiang","outputID":"00047231","output_locID":"00047231-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"}]}
