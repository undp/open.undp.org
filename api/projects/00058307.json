The project will remove systemic, regulatory and knowledge barriers to mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into territorial planning. The objective will be achieved through two outcomes: i) Enabling regulatory, policy and institutional framework for land-use planning that reflects biodiversity considerations outside protected areas, and ii) Tested models for development and enforcement of biodiversity-compatible land-use plans at the district levels.\r\nThe immediate global biodiversity benefits include enhanced ecosystem integrity outside PAs in 10 administrative districts (approximately 2 million hectares). In the long-term, taking into account the sought replication effect, the project will ensure the long-term integrity of fragile ecosystems over 36% of the country.","output_id":"00072384","output_title":"Mainstreaming Biodiversity","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"Mainstreaming Biodiversity Conservation into Territorial Planning Policies and Practices","project_id":"00058307","project_title":"Mainsteraming Biodiversity","region_id":"RBEC","start":"2009-11-01","subnational":[]}
