This is envisaged to be achieved through the combination of regulatory tools such as minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and information labels, enhanced public awareness, capacity building and attractive financing mechanisms. The project will strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework, develop monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and provide training to public authorities and other relevant stakeholders. It will explore and test different financial incentives complemented by extensive public outreach campaigns.","output_id":"00075645","output_title":"Improv.EE of Lighting&Bldg App"}],"project_descr":"Improving the energy efficiency of lighting and other building appliances","project_id":"00060162","project_title":"ImprovingEnergyEfficiency ofLighting&Building Appliances","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2010-06-28","subnational":[{"awardID":"00060162","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"30.06263","lon":"31.24967","name":"Egypt","outputID":"00075645","output_locID":"00075645-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
