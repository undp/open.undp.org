In response to these vulnerabilities, the project, Climate Change Adaptation Programme in the Coastal Zone of Mauritius will help coastal communities fight the adverse effects of climate change through the implementation of climate-resilient development measures. Funded by the Adaptation Fund, and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP in partnership with the Government of Mauritius through the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MoESD), the objective is to increase communal and livelihood climate resilience in coastal areas of Mauritius.  The objective will be achieved through a series of initiatives: by applying adaptation measures to protect currently vulnerable coastal ecosystem and community features (at three priority sites on the island of Mauritius); by developing and implementing an early warning system for incoming surges; through training promoting compliance with climate-proofed planning, design, an location guidelines; by mainstreaming policies and finally by disseminating and managing knowledge to ensure that the benefits from the project are replicated in other areas at risk","output_id":"00080227","output_title":"CC Adaptation in Coastal Zones"}],"project_descr":"Climate Change adaptation programme targeting the vulnerable coastal zones of the Republic of Mauritius","project_id":"00062857","project_title":"Climate Change Adaptation in Coastal Zones","region_id":"RBA","start":"2012-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00062857","focus_area":"4","focus_area_descr":"Environment & sustainable development","lat":"20","lon":"-12","name":"Mauritius","outputID":"00080227","output_locID":"00080227-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
