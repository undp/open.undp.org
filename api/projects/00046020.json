The UN approach to DDR is changing, as departments, agencies and funds work to increase their coordination and effectiveness on DDR. UNDP has played a significant role in recent developments and is well positioned to play a central role in the future of DDR within the UN system. This project document identifies likely future trajectories for UN engagement on DDR and proposes the nature and scope of future UNDP, in particular BCPR's, engagement on DDR. It further outlines the resources and activities required to achieve that goal.","output_id":"00054567","output_title":"DDR - Strengthen UNDP Effect.","zero_years":[]},{"award_id":"00046020","budget":[0.0,971976.0,1288526.0,null],"crs":"73010","crs_descr":"Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation","donor_budget":[0.0],"donor_country":["MULTI-LATERAL AGENCY"],"donor_country_id":["MULTI_AGY"],"donor_expend":[0.0,913463.0,828097.0,96986.0],"donor_id":["00280"],"donor_name":["EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY"],"donor_short":["EU"],"donor_type_id":["MULTI_AGY"],"expenditure":[0.0,913463.0,828097.0,96986.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011","2010"],"focus_area":"3","focus_area_descr":"Crisis prevention & recovery","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":"UN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP ON DISARMEMENT, DEMOBILIZATION AND REINTEGRATION","output_id":"00076535","output_title":"IAWG ON DDR","zero_years":["2013"]}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00046020","project_title":"DDR - Strengthening UNDP Effectiveness in DDR","region_id":"RBA","start":"2007-01-01","subnational":[]}
