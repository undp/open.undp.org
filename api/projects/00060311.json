On the supply-side the Programme will work with the police, judiciary, prosecution, prisons, and Ombudsman offices, while on the demand side it will work with civil society organizations and local communities to strengthen access to justice for poor and vulnerable citizens. The Program is slated to work in 36 districts across all 4 provinces and the GB region for enhancing legal awareness, providing legal aid, and building public trust in justice sector institutions.
