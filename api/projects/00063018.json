The LGSP program guides the delivery of quite substantial amounts of Local Development Funds which are increasingly being channeled through local level decision making structures. These funds genuinely provide greater flexibility for local administrations to reflect the needs of local communities. And yet they remain relatively weak in terms of addressing environmental and climate related concerns.The project expects to ensure that future small scale rural infrastructure, that is essential to local needs, is designed and constructed in a way that takes into account climate related risks including existing variability and longer term fundamental change. This will be built on an existing and ongoing process of strengthening local governance systems and public participation.","output_id":"00080317","output_title":"Strengthening the Resilience o"}],"project_descr":"Strengthening the Resilience of Small Scale Rural Infrastructure and Local Government Systems to Climate Risk","project_id":"00063018","project_title":"Strengthening the Resilience of Small Rural Infrastructu","region_id":"RBAP","start":"2012-04-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00063018","focus_area":"1","focus_area_descr":"Poverty reduction & MDG achievement","lat":"-8.83333","lon":"125.75","name":"Timor Leste","outputID":"00080317","output_locID":"00080317-1","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
