Final outcomes would include permanently staffed, technically autonomous and financially sustainable Protected Area Management Units with clear mandates and appropriate planning, monitoring and law enforcement prerogatives. Collaborative management agreements would involve key stakeholders in the adaptive, equitable and sustainable use of biodiversity resources and the development of innovative, environmentally-compatible, economic activities which meet livelihood needs. An adaptive management planning process will formalize operational links between the two Protected Area Management Units, integrate PA management with local and national cross-sectoral development plans and policies and provide a basis for future bio-regional planning and transnational biodiversity conservation and sustainable use initiatives.","output_id":"00034575","output_title":"Conservation Biodiversit\u00e9"}],"project_descr":"Conservation et utilisation durable de la Biodiversit\u00e9 d'int\u00e9r\u00eat Mondial dans les deux parcs du Tassili et de l'Ahaggar","project_id":"00033348","project_title":"Conservation de Biodiversit\u00e9 des parcs Tassili-Ahaggar","region_id":"RBAS","start":"2004-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"26.08333","lon":"6","name":"Tassili n Ajjer","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-1","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"26.08333","lon":"6","name":"Tassili n Ajjer","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-2","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"22.785","lon":"5.52278","name":"Tamanrasset","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-3","precision":"3","type":"PPLA"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"23.16667","lon":"5.83333","name":"Ahaggar","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-4","precision":"4","type":"RES"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"23.16667","lon":"5.83333","name":"Ahaggar","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-5","precision":"4","type":"RES"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"26.83333","lon":"8.16667","name":"Illizi","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-6","precision":"4","type":"ADM1"},{"awardID":"00033348","focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","lat":"20.44326","lon":"4.71008","name":"Tassili Ahaggar","outputID":"00034575","output_locID":"00034575-7","precision":"4","type":"RES"}]}
